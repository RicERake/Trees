  <h2 class="Facts">Interesting Facts About Trees:</h2>
  <p> 
  <div id="paragraph1">
    Trees are incredible organisms that provide numerous benefits to the environment and all life forms.
    Here are some fascinating facts about trees:</div>
  <ul>
    <li>Trees are the longest-living organisms on Earth, 
      with some species living for thousands of years. 
      The Methuselah tree, a bristlecone pine in California, 
      is estimated to be over 4,800 years old.</li>

    <li>Trees have the remarkable ability to absorb carbon dioxide and 
      release oxygen through photosynthesis. A single mature tree can produce enough oxygen to 
      support two people per year.</li>
    
    <li>Trees have intricate root systems that help prevent soil erosion and maintain water quality. 
      Their roots also play a crucial role in forming symbiotic relationships with fungi, 
      exchanging nutrients and creating a healthier ecosystem.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <div id="paragraph2">Unfortunately, trees worldwide are facing a rapid decline due to various 
    factors, including deforestation, climate change, disease, and human activities. 
    The consequences of this loss are far-reaching:</div>

  <ul>
    <li>Loss of Biodiversity: Trees provide habitat for countless species, and their decline
     threatens the survival of diverse ecosystems. Many animals, insects, and plants depend on trees 
     for shelter, food, and reproduction.</li>
  
    <li>Increased Carbon Dioxide Levels: With fewer trees to absorb carbon dioxide, 
    greenhouse gas emissions rise, exacerbating climate change. This contributes to global warming, 
    more frequent extreme weather events, and further environmental degradation.</li>

    <li>Soil Degradation and Water Scarcity: Trees play a vital role in maintaining soil health by 
    preventing erosion and retaining moisture. Their decline leads to reduced soil fertility, 
    increased desertification, and water scarcity, impacting agricultural productivity and human 
    communities that rely on these resources.</li>

  </ul>

  <div id="paragraph3">It is crucial to address the issue of tree decline through sustainable 
    practices such as reforestation, conservation efforts, and responsible land management. 
    Preserving and replenishing tree populations is essential for maintaining the health of our 
    planet and safeguarding the countless benefits that trees provide to ecosystems and human
     well-being.</div>
